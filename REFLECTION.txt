I learned about making high level design choices that would impact the rest of my code down the line. 
I think the most challenging part was thinking about what each method had to do. Many of my methods were long and 
had many if statements. It would probably make my code better if those statements were written in helper methods to make it more readable.
I need to improve on making my methods one purpose to make it more readable and understandable.
